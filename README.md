Credit Card Fraud Detection


Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for credit card fraud detection. The goal of this project is to build and deploy a model that can effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions.


Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Dataset Source], containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over a two-day period, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transaction.



Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yash0539s/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt



Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: Baseline model for classification.
Random Forest: Ensemble model to improve prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Boosted trees for improved performance.


Results
Logistic Regression: Accuracy: [accuracy], F1-score: [f1-score].
Random Forest: Accuracy: [accuracy], F1-score: [f1-score].
Gradient Boosting: Accuracy: [accuracy], F1-score: [f1-score].
